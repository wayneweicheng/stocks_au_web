### 1. Executive Verdict
**Mildly Bullish (Caution)** - The breakout shows strong initial demand with smart accumulation, but faces an Active Bagholder Wall at $0.029 from recent high-volume selling. The Volume Spike condition is PASSED, but overhead resistance requires caution.

### 2. The Structural Analysis (60-Day View)
- **Structure Type:** Flat Base. The stock consolidated between approximately $0.022 and $0.038 from late October 2025 to the breakout, building energy.
- **Trend Status:** Price ($0.037) is above its 20-day SMA (~$0.031) and 50-day SMA (~$0.030), indicating a bullish trend alignment.
- **Compression:** Yes. The 5 days leading to the breakout (2025-12-29 to 2026-01-02) showed relatively tight daily ranges.
- **Volume Spike:** PASS. Breakout Day (2026-01-02) volume of 19,417,962 is the highest of the preceding 5 trading days.
- **Key Resistance:** $0.029 (Bagholder Wall) - **ACTIVE**. The high-volume red day (Close < Open) on 2025-12-09 occurred 16 trading days prior to the breakout, well within the 30-day cutoff. This represents recent trapped supply.

### 4. The "Smart Money" Analysis
- **The Winner (Top Net Buyer):** Wealthhub
- **Smart Retail Check:** PASS. Wealthhub is a retail broker, and its Average Buy Price ($0.0377) is **below** the Day 1 VWAP ($0.0375).
- **Winner Avg Price:** $0.0377 vs. Day 1 VWAP: $0.0375
- **Insight:** Wealthhub (retail) was the dominant net buyer, accumulating at prices slightly below the VWAP. They absorbed significant volume from OpenMarkets (a major net seller), suggesting demand overcame institutional supply on the breakout day.

### 5. The Retest (Day 2 & 3)
- **Day 2 Hold:** Top 50% -> PASS. Day 1 Range (High $0.039 - Low $0.033 = $0.006). Top 50% threshold = $0.036. Day 2 Close was $0.038.
- **Volume:** Dried up significantly. Day 2 volume (9,267,797) was ~52% of Day 1 volume, and Day 3 volume (5,001,509) was ~27% of Day 1 volume.

### 6. Trade Plan
- **Strategy:** Cautious Buy on Pullback. The presence of Active Supply overhead makes an immediate aggressive entry risky.
- **Buy Zone:** $0.034 - $0.036. This area represents the lower half of the Day 1 breakout range and potential support.
- **Invalidation:** A close below $0.033 (Day 1 low) would signal a failed breakout and invalidate the setup.
