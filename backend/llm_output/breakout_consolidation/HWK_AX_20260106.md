**Executive Verdict:** MILDLY BULLISH / CAUTION. The breakout shows promising "smart money" accumulation and a solid structural base, but the setup is critically downgraded because the **Volume Spike rule FAILED** (Day 1 volume was not the largest of the last 5 trading days).

**The Structural Analysis (60-Day View)**
*   **Structure Type:** Flat Base. The price action from mid-April to late May shows a clear consolidation range between approximately $0.50 and $0.58, building energy for a directional move.
*   **Trend Status:** Bullish. Price is above both the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), confirming an uptrend on an intermediate timeframe.
*   **Compression:** Yes. The 5 days leading into the breakout (May 24, 27, 28, 29, 30) show narrowing daily ranges and declining volatility, indicating a coiling spring.
*   **Volume Spike:** **FAIL**. While Day 1 (May 31) volume of 4.2M is significant, it is **not** the largest of the last 5 trading days. Volume on May 29 was 4.8M. This failure violates a strict rule for a high-conviction breakout and suggests the initial surge lacked maximum institutional participation.
*   **Key Resistance:** **$0.60 (ACTIVE Bagholder Wall)**. A high-volume red day occurred on **May 23** (within the last 30 trading days) with a high of $0.60. This price is above the Breakout Day (May 31) close of $0.585, creating a nearby supply zone of trapped sellers.

**Broker Audit Table**
| Broker Name | Total Bought | Total Sold | Net Volume | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CommSec | 1,200,000 | 800,000 | +400,000 | Net Buyer |
| Macquarie | 950,000 | 1,100,000 | -150,000 | Net Seller |
| UBS | 750,000 | 900,000 | -150,000 | Net Seller |
| Morgan Stanley | 600,000 | 450,000 | +150,000 | Net Buyer |
| Jarden | 500,000 | 950,000 | -450,000 | Net Seller |

**The "Smart Money" Analysis**
*   **The Winner (Top Net Buyer):** CommSec
*   **Smart Retail Check:** **PASS**. CommSec's Average Buy Price was **$0.580**, which is **below** the Day 1 VWAP of **$0.582**. This indicates accumulation at favorable prices, not FOMO chasing.
*   **Winner Avg Price:** $0.580 vs. Day 1 VWAP: $0.582
*   **Insight:** Retail (CommSec) was the dominant net buyer, accumulating stock specifically against selling from institutional brokers Macquarie, UBS, and Jarden. This is a classic sign of "smart retail" or insider absorption of institutional supply.

**The Retest (Day 2 & 3)**
*   **Day 2 Hold:** **Top 50%** -> **PASS**. Day 1 range was $0.565 (Low) to $0.590 (High) = $0.025 range. The top 50% of this range is above $0.5775. Day 2 (June 3) closed at $0.580, which is within the top 50%.
*   **Volume:** **Dried up**. Day 2 volume of 2.1M is roughly half of Day 1's volume, indicating a lack of selling pressure during the pullback—a positive sign.

**Trade Plan**
*   **Strategy:** Cautious Buy on Weakness. The failed volume spike mandates a more conservative approach. Await a pullback into the buy zone for a better risk/reward entry.
*   **Buy Zone:** $0.575 - $0.580 (aligns with the top of the prior base and the "smart money" average buy price).
*   **Invalidation:** A daily close below **$0.565** (the low of the breakout day) would signal a failed breakout and invalidate the bullish thesis.
